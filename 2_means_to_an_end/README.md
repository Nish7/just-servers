## Local Test Commands
This goes through the test sequence in the example session
```sh
(
    printf '\x49\x00\x00\x30\x39\x00\x00\x00\x65'  # I 12345 101
    printf '\x49\x00\x00\x30\x3a\x00\x00\x00\x66'  # I 12346 102
    printf '\x49\x00\x00\x30\x3b\x00\x00\x00\x64'  # I 12347 100
    printf '\x49\x00\x00\xa0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x05'  # I 40960 5
    printf '\x51\x00\x00\x30\x00\x00\x00\x40\x00'  # Q 12288 16384
) | nc -4 -q -1 localhost 8082

- Each client tracks the price of a different asset. Clients send messages to the server that either insert or query the prices.
- Each connection from a client is a separate session. Each session's data represents a different asset, so each session can only query the data supplied by itself.

Message Format:
- 9 bytes long - 72 bits
- 1st byte is indentifier  - in ASCII endcoding
- 2nd and 3rd segmetns of each 4bytes is in two complement 32 bits integer conversion

Takeaways:
- Using `buf:=make([]byte, 2048)` vs `bufio.NewReader`. While in the PROTO-1 i used bufio.NewReader, the decison on to use simple buf was made due the nature of the data being received. While in PROTO-1 it was json data
with new line and general delimeter capabilities. Thus always be mindful of type or struct to use.
    - Low-level Reading: This method provides more control but requires you to handle all the detailsâ€”like splitting the incoming data into meaningful chunks (e.g., splitting it into lines, messages, etc.).

- Sending binary data is much more complicated rather than processing it. Binary data needs to be send in a 
byte form rather than ASCII binary strings. Which would happen if you add "100101" in the stdin on the nc 
console.
    - Sending the binary strings would simply mean we would be sending the ASCII codes for those digits
    - Ex. "01000001" -> would be sending 0x30, 0x31, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30, 0x31
    - Rather than -> 0x41
    - So How do we send byte form "binary data": `printf '\x41\x00\x01\xE2\x40\xFF\xF3\xF6\x1C' | nc <server-ip> <port>`
    
- During my initial testing on the protohacker test suite, it seems to decode the binary incorrectly. 
I assumed incoming data was the byte form, which is not the case, given it would be coming individualy
binary bits. 
    - So if it was sending `10100110000` it was being recieved in this format `100110 0 0 0`. Which is basically still 9 bytes but each individual zeros was being considered as single byte (8 bits)
    - printf seems to send the binary bits in the byte form to the nc which worked in those given sitations
    - However, other tcp clients are not neccessarly sending in that byte form
    - Consdiering that the issue, the bigger question was to how do we even consider in the bit form given TCP handles in byte form on the network level
    - After lots of googling. Answer to that question lied on the `binary` package. with its usage of `.Read()`
    - Previous implement of the `conn.Read()` read in the byte form. Which produced incorrect decoding

- The two's complement system is used in computing because it simplifies the representation and arithmetic operations on signed integers 
    - postive numbers are converted normally
    - For negative number are converted and inverted. then add 1
    - addition circuitlry can be reused for both subtraction

- Convertion to twos complement is really intresting 
    -  firstly, it assumes the data is in big-endian Format. Which mean MSB comes first
    -  In Big-Endian, the most significant byte (0x12) is stored at the lowest memory address (first = 0)
    - We have currently used binary package to handle the combining the 4 bytes into a 32 bit integer, internallly, it is handled by shifting the bits by its respective position in 32bit size and then using an 
    OR operator on those.
    - type casting `int32` on the 4 bytes would handle the conversion for twos complement


- Considering Data Race conditions could happen if using a shared map is being accessed by bunch of go routines
    - we make it safe by the use of mutex and sync.map
    - However, i opted for more secure by design approach
    - Rather making a shared map and accessing those, will create a new map per connection and keep track of that.
    - It would be a connection/session specific state managed, whenever we drop the go routine we clean up
    database as well. Which is an intended feature

- Data Size Issue: Handling Sum for calculating mean value required me to use int64 rather than int32.Which caused massive bug on my end when dealing with large number of input insertions and price values casuing overflow
    - int32 can only handle -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. and while we do take those as input, the sum
    of those is greater than int32.
